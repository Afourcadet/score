   	== By Hand
	   . Download and install libraries from :
			  Qt 5.1 or more recent (LGPL) : http://qt-project.org/downloads
	   		  Gecode 3.2.0 : http://www.gecode.org/download/Gecode-3.2.0.dmg
		  LibXml2 : http://www.explain.com.au/download/combo-2007-10-07.dmg.gz -> copy libxml.framework to /Library/Frameworks

	   . Get git repositories by downloading (or cloning) :
	   		  Score : https://github.com/OSSIA/Score
			  i-score : https://github.com/OSSIA/i-score

	   . Build Score, following the steps in the README.

	   . Create a build directory for i-score (mkdir and cd)
	   . qmake -spec macx-clang PATH_TO_GIT_REPO_ISCORE
	     Warning : If you have multiple versions of Qt in your Mac a problem may appear using "qmake" command, because it will use the old one (qmake version 2.01)
	     Qt5 will install stuff in a Qt folder in your Home. To create the Makefile properly you have to launch qmake v3.0 (somewhere in Qt/5.XXX/clang_64/bin/qmake) 
	   . make
