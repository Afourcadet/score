 *  This class constructs the main interface of i-score, notably in relation with the designer's file "mainwindow.ui".
 *  A StateMachine permits to identify and drive the changes beetween the main states of i-score, like the user is in edition or execution mode.
 *  MainWindow is aware of the hierarchical changes of timeBox, to maintain the _pCurrentTimebox (actual timebox in fullView), and permits to connect this timebox with the headerWiget.
 *
 *  @todo Creer une classe Editor pour regrouper GraphicsView, HeaderWidget, et la gestion des timebox. MainWindow ne devrait pas etre au courant et s'en occuper des timebox pour une meilleure sÃ©paration.
